# OOD Monitoring Using B-VAE

In this work we introduce the B-Variational Autoencoder (B-VAE) monitor to detect out-of-Distribution images and isolate the change in the factors (e.g.,brightness, precipitation,etc.). Typically, this is a multi-class classification problem solved using a chain of one-class classifiers. However, in this work we use a single efficient B-VAE monitor that uses the principle of disentanglement to train the latent space to be sensitive to distribution shifts in different generative factors. That is to say, we find the latent unit(s) encoding information about a generative factor and use it in an Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) framework to identify images that are OOD. 

We demonstrate our approach using an end-to-end driving controller in the CARLA simulator.

# Setup

To run the CARLA setup with varied weather patterns and evaluate the B-VAE monitor, clone this repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/Shreyasramakrishna90/B-VAE-OOD-Monitor
```
Then create a conda environment with python 3.7 and install the requirements as follows.

```
To run this setup first create a virtual environment with python 3.7
conda create -n py37 python=3.7
conda activate py37
cd ${B-VAE-OOD-Monitor}  # Change ${B-VAE-OOD-Monitor} for your CARLA root folder
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
You will also need to install CARLA 0.9.6. See [link](https://carla.org/2019/07/12/release-0.9.6/) for more instructions.

# Steps to implement the B-VAE monitor for OOD detection in CARLA simulator


1.  [Data generation](https://github.com/Shreyasramakrishna90/B-VAE-OOD-Monitor/tree/master/data-generation) -- Generate CARLA scenes with varied weather parameters. 

2. [lec-training](https://github.com/Shreyasramakrishna90/B-VAE-OOD-Monitor/tree/master/lec-training) -- Train an end-to-end LEC to steer the autonomous vehicle around CARLA towns. The LEC used here is based on [NVIDIA'S DAVE-II](https://arxiv-org.proxy.library.vanderbilt.edu/pdf/1604.07316.pdf?source=post_page---------------------------) DNN architecture.

2. [hyperparameter tuning](https://github.com/Shreyasramakrishna90/B-VAE-OOD-Monitor/tree/master/hyperparameter-tuning) -- Tune the B-VAE hyperparameters of Beta (B) and number of latent units (B). Three algorithms have been used in this work: Bayesian optimization, random search and grid search.

3. [latent-unit-extraction](https://github.com/Shreyasramakrishna90/B-VAE-OOD-Monitor/tree/master/latent-unit-extraction) -- Extract and plot latent units using the selected B-VAE monitor. Then compare the latent units across several CARLA scenes to select the detector latent units (Ld) and diagnoser latent units (Lf)

4. [Carla-runtime-deployment](https://github.com/Shreyasramakrishna90/B-VAE-OOD-Monitor/tree/master/carla-runtime-deployment) -- Deploy the designed B-VAE monitor in CARLA simulation.

# Extentions From the Earlier Work

1. Data generation -- Data generator which uses random sampler to sample the CARLA weather parameters such as (sun, cloud, rain, illumination), and generate different scenes.

2. Hyperparameter selection -- We perform Bayesian Optimization with [Mutual Information Gap](https://arxiv-org.proxy.library.vanderbilt.edu/pdf/1802.04942.pdf) as the optimization criteria to select the number of latent units (n) and B value. 

3. Comparison to existing technologies -- We compare our B-VAE monitor (detection + diagnosis) with other techniques such as SVDD, VAE based reconstruction, SVDD-chain, and VAE-reconstruction-chain.
